### Notes

- Function calls fail altogether if there aren't sufficient resources. Civilizations are not smart enough to carry out partial instructions.
- This world is minimally tested. Civilizations beware. Alternatively try to break it to win an award.
- This world is expensive. There are no gas optimizations. Be careful trying to do too much in your strategies.
- This world has no medicine. All soldiers in a fight die.
- This world is not our world. Not everything works as you expect. Go explore and try things!
